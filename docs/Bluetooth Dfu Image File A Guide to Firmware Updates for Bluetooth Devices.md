Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode is a special mode that allows you to update the firmware of your Bluetooth device over the configured host interface. This can be useful when you want to improve the performance, fix bugs, or add new features to your device. In this article, we will explain how to use DFU mode to upload a new firmware image file to your Bluetooth device.

## What is a Bluetooth DFU Image File?
 
A Bluetooth DFU image file is a binary file that contains the new firmware for your Bluetooth device. The file format may vary depending on the device manufacturer and model, but typically it has a .bin extension. You can obtain the latest firmware image file for your device from the official website of the manufacturer or from other trusted sources.
 
## How to Enter DFU Mode on Your Bluetooth Device?
 
The procedure to enter DFU mode on your Bluetooth device may differ depending on the device type and model, but generally it involves the following steps:
 
- Connect your Bluetooth device to your computer or smartphone via USB, UART, or BLE.
- Send a DFU reset command to your device using a dedicated software tool or application. This will reboot your device into DFU mode.
- Wait for a DFU boot event from your device, which indicates that it is ready to receive the new firmware image file.

## How to Upload a New Firmware Image File to Your Bluetooth Device?
 
Once your Bluetooth device is in DFU mode, you can upload the new firmware image file to it using a dedicated software tool or application. You can either use Apploader or user application, as follows:

- Apploader: The Apploader is a simple application that is separated from the main application and has a minimal Bluetooth stack that handles the upload process. You can use Apploader if you do not have a custom user application for your device or if you want to avoid any interference from the user application during the upload process.
- User application: The user application is your own custom application that runs on your device and provides the functionality and features that you want. You can use user application if you have implemented OTA DFU support in your application and if you want to have more control over the upload process.

The upload process involves the following steps:

- Send a Flash Set Address command to your device to define the starting address on the flash where the new firmware will be written.
- Upload the firmware image file to your device using Flash Upload commands until all the data has been uploaded. The data length must be a multiple of 4 bytes and the flash address will be automatically updated by the bootloader after each command.
- Send a Flash Upload Finish command to your device when all the data has been uploaded.
- Finalize the firmware update by sending a Reset command to your device. This will reboot your device into normal mode with the new firmware.
