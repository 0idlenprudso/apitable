If you are a fan of martial arts movies, you might want to check out *Iceman*, a 2014 Chinese film starring Donnie Yen as a frozen Ming Dynasty warrior who wakes up in modern-day Hong Kong. The movie is a remake of the 1989 film *The Iceman Cometh*, which starred Yuen Biao and Maggie Cheung.
 
*Iceman* follows the story of Ying (Donnie Yen), a loyal imperial guard who is framed for murder and betrayed by his three childhood friends, Sao (Wang Baoqiang), Yuanlong (Simon Yam) and Niehu (Yu Kang). During a fierce battle in the snow, they are all buried and frozen for 400 years. In the present day, they are accidentally thawed out by a mysterious financier (Lam Suet) who wants to use them for his own purposes. Ying escapes and meets May (Huang Shengyi), a drunken woman who helps him adapt to the modern world. Meanwhile, Sao, Yuanlong and Niehu resume their hunt for Ying, causing chaos and destruction in the city.

*Iceman* is a mix of action, comedy and sci-fi elements, with impressive fight scenes and special effects. Donnie Yen showcases his skills in various styles of martial arts, such as swordplay, kung fu and parkour. He also displays his comedic side, as he tries to cope with the culture shock of the 21st century. The movie also features a cameo by Jackie Chan, who plays himself in a hilarious scene.
 
The movie was originally intended to be released as two parts, but only the first part was completed and released in 2014. The second part was delayed due to production issues and legal disputes. As of now, there is no official confirmation on when or if the sequel will be released.

*Iceman* is a fun and entertaining movie that will appeal to fans of Donnie Yen and martial arts movies in general. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is worth watching for its action-packed scenes and humorous moments.
  
*Iceman* received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised Donnie Yen's performance and action scenes, but criticized the plot, the direction, the editing and the tone. The movie has a 32% rating on Metacritic and a 4.7/10 rating on IMDb. Some reviewers compared it unfavorably to the original 1989 film, which they felt had more charm and humor.
 
Despite the negative reviews, *Iceman* was a commercial success in China, where it grossed over 100 million yuan (about US$16 million) at the box office. It also performed well in other Asian markets, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. However, it did not get a wide release in North America or Europe, where it was only available on DVD or online platforms.
 
The sequel, *Iceman: The Time Traveller*, was released in 2018, four years after the first part. It continued the story of Ying and his enemies as they travel back to the Ming Dynasty to settle their scores. The sequel also received mostly negative reviews, with critics calling it a disappointing and unnecessary follow-up. It also failed to match the box office success of the first part, earning only 28 million yuan (about US$4 million) in China.
